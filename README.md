# Hotel_Management_System-Project
This Java Hotel Management System (HMS) streamlines hotel operations via a GUI. It manages user logins, staff, rooms (add, view, search, update), customer bookings (new, check-out), and drivers. Features include secure access, detailed room and guest management, and MySQL database integration for efficient data handling.
