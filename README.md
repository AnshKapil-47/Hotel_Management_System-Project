# Hotel_Management_System-Project
This Java Hotel Management System (HMS) streamlines hotel operations via a GUI. It manages user logins, staff, rooms (add, view, search, update), customer bookings (new, check-out), and drivers. Features include secure access, detailed room and guest management, and MySQL database integration for efficient data handling.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure login system for different user roles (e.g., admin, reception).
Employee Management: Add, view, and manage employee details, including managers and general staff.

Room Management:
Add new rooms with details like room number, availability, cleaning status, price, and bed type.
View all available rooms and their details.
Update room status (e.g., cleaning status, availability).
Search for rooms based on various criteria (e.g., bed type, availability).

Customer Management:
Add new customer bookings with personal details, room allocation, check-in time, and deposit information.
View details of all customers.
Handle customer check-out processes.
Update customer check-in details.
Driver Management: Add and manage driver information, including car details and availability for pick-up services.
Department Overview: View departmental information.
Dashboard: Provides an administrative interface and access to reception functionalities.
Database Connectivity: Integrates with a database (likely MySQL, given the conn.java file) to store and retrieve all hotel data.

Technologies Used:
Java (Swing/AWT): For building the graphical user interface.
JDBC: For database connectivity.
MySQL (Assumed): Database for storing hotel data.

This project aims to automate and simplify daily hotel operations, providing a robust solution for managing guests, staff, and resources efficiently.
